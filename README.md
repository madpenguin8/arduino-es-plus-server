arduino-es-plus-server
======================

Arduino based server that gives Gardner Denver速 air compressors 
equipped with the ES+速 controller ethernet connectivity.

Data from the controller is returned as a JSON object containing
all three requests to the controller, they are:

 operating data <STX>oo<ETX>
 operating mode <STX>mm<ETX>
 service data <STX>BB<ETX>
 
 This is an example of the JSON data returned:
 
{
  "opdata": "059806270C6A0B9F065", 
  "opmode": "110D", 
  "servicedata": "00C3$27400753#20400752#28400752#28400752#28400752#27400744#28400744#28400744#06400744#08400742$400795#309892$000009#000030#000000#000000#000000#000043#346025#025206#016686#007899#004695#000202$400713#400731$0000736"
}

Currently only 9600 baud is supported but support is planned for 1200 as well.

This software in theory should work on RS2000速 controllers as well since the
requests and responses to and from the controllers are identical to ES+速. 
However, in practice it seems to fail. I have not had time to track down the
problem but I think it is in the delay() in the Serial.available() loop.

Hardware used in this configuration is an Arduino UNO, Arduino Ethernet shield
( Wiznet 5100 ) and a typical MAX232 TTL to RS232 level shifter circuit.
